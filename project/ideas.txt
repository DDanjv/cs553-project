ideas for project 
    * task Manager
        use can create to do lists 
        and store them in data base 
        under there user. each list will have an id 
        . it will also store 
        the user ids to know who can use it 

    * library catalog
        a user can create library 
        catalogs and the add 
        different book listing 
        to them. catalogs will 
        store user ids to know who can edit.

    * simple drawing app that can store projects 
        has a canvnas that a user can draw on in a 512 by 512 grid. 
        there drawing can be safe to there user on database. 
        will store user ids to know who can used and who made it.

    * messager app
        users can create chats bweteen each other. it would use 
         ids for chat and also hold user ids to know who is in the chat.
    * blog app
         a user can create text post and save it to there list.

    all project will have get, create, del, and edit functions

    will use react of next js for frame work.
    leaning to next js as react has been Depreciated.
